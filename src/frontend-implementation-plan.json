      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On desktop breakpoints, the Call History panel renders in the area where the Number Board previously rendered, and the Number Board renders in the area where the Call History panel previously rendered.",
        "On mobile breakpoints, the relative order/placement of Call History vs Number Board is swapped compared to the current implementation (i.e., the same swap applies responsively, not only on desktop).",
        "No gameplay logic changes: called numbers, undo behavior, auto-draw behavior, and persistence remain unchanged.",
        "The Call History list still displays most-recent-first (reverse chronological display) as it does currently.",
        "No duplicate HistoryPanel instances are shown at the same breakpoint (e.g., avoid rendering both the lg:hidden and lg:block versions simultaneously after the layout change)."

Remove the breakpoint-split duplicate HistoryPanel rendering (lg:hidden / lg:block) to ensure only a single HistoryPanel instance is rendered at any breakpoint, and keep existing props wiring to preserve current gameplay behavior and reverse-chronological history display."
