# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Adjust the Tambola gameplay UI layout and labels for clearer control placement and a more compact Last Number display.

**Planned changes:**
- Move the “New Game” button to appear above the “Last Number” display, keeping the existing Yes/No confirmation flow, and remove its previous placement from the controls area.
- Reduce the visual size of the “Last Number” display card (padding) and the circular number/placeholder element while keeping it responsive and readable on mobile and desktop.
- Rename the primary draw button label from “Draw Next” to “Draw Number” everywhere in the UI.
- Move the “Undo” button to render below the Number Board (beneath the number grid), preserving existing enabled/disabled behavior, and remove it from the controls card.

**User-visible outcome:** The gameplay screen shows “New Game” above a smaller Last Number box, the draw button reads “Draw Number,” and “Undo” appears beneath the number grid instead of in the controls area.
