  "summary": "Diff implements exact-number clip lookup via IndexedDB keyed by full number and updates announcement sequencing to ensure digit steps use TTS and only the final full-number step is recording-eligible. However, the requested “Host Voice Recordings” manager dialog UI (grid/controls/badge/refresh-on-open) is not evidenced in the provided diff summary. Several unrelated Tambola UI/AutoDraw/theme changes appear that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Keep (or recreate if missing) a “Host Voice Recordings” manager UI matching the screenshot: dialog titled “Host Voice Recordings” with instructions, scrollable 1–90 grid, per-number record/stop controls, and per-number play/delete controls when recording exists, recorded count badge, and Close button; opening refreshes list from storage.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows changes to voice announcement logic and an IndexedDB clip store, but does not show any dialog/UI component implementation for managing recordings (no evidence of a dialog, grid UI, record/stop/play/delete controls, recorded-count footer, or refresh-on-open behavior).",
