  "summary": "REQ-4 is implemented (liveVersion.ts set to Draft 52 with a deployment date). However, the diff introduces behavioral changes to voice settings storage (defaults and clearing localStorage) and includes meta/documentation updates, which conflicts with REQ-2’s requirement to deploy Draft 52 code as-is with no functional/UX changes. The diff does not provide evidence of an actual rollback/redeploy to Draft 52 codebase; it shows code edits instead.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Rebuild and deploy the application using the code exactly as it exists in draft version 52, discarding drafts 53 and 54 and making no functional or visual changes beyond selecting draft 52 for the live deployment.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new/changed runtime behavior (voice settings defaults and clearing localStorage) rather than selecting/deploying the existing Draft 52 code as-is. There is also no diff evidence indicating a rollback of code to the Draft 52 snapshot or a deployment selection change; only targeted file edits are shown.",

      "description": "Clear any existing stored voice settings from localStorage on startup via clearStoredVoiceSettings().",

      "reason": "Not requested; while REQ-3 asks to ensure the default is OFF, it does not ask to remove persistence or redesign settings storage. This is a functional behavior change and contradicts REQ-2’s 'as-is' constraint.",
