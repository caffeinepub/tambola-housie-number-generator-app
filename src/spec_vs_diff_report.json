  "summary": "All four requested UI changes appear to be implemented: New Game is moved above Last Number with a Yes/No confirmation dialog, Last Number display is resized smaller, the draw button label is changed to “Draw Number”, and Undo is moved below the Number Board and removed from the controls card. However, the diff also includes additional unrequested theming/layout changes (e.g., global styles/Tailwind config updates and moving the NumberBoard out of the main 3-column grid).",
