  "summary": "The diff updates the gameplay layout in `frontend/src/App.tsx`, placing `HistoryPanel` inside the main grid and moving `NumberBoard` to a section below the grid. This appears intended to swap panel positions, but the diff summary does not include the prior layout, so full verification of the requested “swap compared to current implementation” (desktop and mobile) is not provable from the provided evidence alone. A new footer/promo element also appears to be introduced, which was not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "On desktop breakpoints, the Call History panel renders in the area where the Number Board previously rendered, and the Number Board renders in the area where the Call History panel previously rendered.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the *new* placement (HistoryPanel in the `lg:grid-cols-3` grid and NumberBoard below), but does not show the previous layout, so it cannot be confirmed that this is a true swap relative to the prior desktop placement.",

      "requirement": "On mobile breakpoints, the relative order/placement of Call History vs Number Board is swapped compared to the current implementation (i.e., the same swap applies responsively, not only on desktop).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a single-column grid on mobile (default) with HistoryPanel inside the grid and NumberBoard below, but without the previous implementation it cannot be verified that this constitutes a swap vs the prior mobile ordering/placement.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest is UI-only and specifically scoped to swapping Number Board and Call History positions; it lists adding new unrelated UI elements as a non-goal. The footer/promo content is unrelated to the requested swap.",
