The diff summary does not provide direct code evidence that the footer text/bullet were updated, and it shows substantial unrelated application logic changes in App.tsx plus metadata changes in project_state.json.",

      "requirement": "Remove only the footer text that displays “Draft 34” (the live version label) while keeping the rest of the footer content and layout unchanged (including no leftover separator/bullet).",
      "reason": "The provided App.tsx diff is truncated before any footer rendering, so there is no direct evidence in the diff snippet that “Draft 34” was removed and that no extra separator (e.g., “•”) remains.
