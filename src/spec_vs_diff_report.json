REQ-11 appears implemented with distinct quickReset vs newGame handlers and persistence updates. REQ-10 (confirmation popups with exact required English text and Yes/No buttons) cannot be fully verified from the provided truncated diff because the AlertDialog JSX/text/buttons are not shown.",

      "requirement": "Show a confirmation popup (Yes/No) for both Quick Reset and New Game with the exact specified English text prompts, and only proceed on \"Yes\".",
      "reason": "GameControls.tsx imports AlertDialog components and sets dialog state, but the truncated diff does not include the AlertDialog JSX that would prove (a) the dialogs render, (b) the exact prompt strings (\"Do you want to reset?\" / \"Do you want to start a new game?\"), and (c) the presence/labels of \"Yes\" and \"No\" buttons and their behaviors.",
